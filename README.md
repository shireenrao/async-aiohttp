# Learning asyncio and aiohttp

This repo contains code for doing different tasks synchronously and asynchronously.

1. sync_demo.py and async_demo.py - This was taken from https://us-pycon-2019-tutorial.readthedocs.io/index.html. This 
shows concepts of how to use the async framework. 

2. sync_peps.py and async_peps.ph - This takes it further from the same tutorial above. We are downloading peps from the internet. First using 
synchronous techniques and then using asyncio and aiohttp. 
 
3. sync_scrape.py and async_scrape.py - This is a project I came up with based on what I learnt in the tutorial. The aim is 
to download images from NASA'a "Astronomy Picture of the Day Archive".
